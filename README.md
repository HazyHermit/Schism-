# Schism
    A point and click exploration game made by Hazelle Malonzo 

# Where to play your game (a link to your deployed game)

# How your design satisfies the experience requirements below
    The game uses both continuous and discrete inputs from the player: 
        continuous - Player can hold down arrow keys to move left, right, or jump. 
        discrete - Player can also press number keys to change scenes. Player can also collect treats using Sol.

    The playerâ€™s goal can only be achieved indirectly (by allowing the physics engine to move key objects into position/contact): 
        In scene 2 and 3, player has to get on top of the train to retrieve the treat. If player is controlling Lune, they can also push Sol around. 

    3+ physics-based gameplay scenes (possibly implemented with a single Phaser Scene subclass).- 
        scene 1: non pushable and pushable characters (Lune can push sol because sol is a smol dog, but sol can not push Lune), player can switch between Lune and Sol. 
        scene 2: Sol has to jump onto the train to get to the treat. 
        scene 3: Sol has to collect the treat on top of the lamp and Lune gets to the arrow.

    Other scenes are used to separate and contextualize the gameplay scenes - Scene intros nested in between each scene to explain the objective of each scene.
